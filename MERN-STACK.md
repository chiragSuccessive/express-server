#MERN STACK
*  MERN Stack is a combination of four technologies — MongoDB(M), Express(E), React(R), NodeJS(N).
#### NODE.JS
* Node.js is an open source server environment.
* Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
* Node.js handles file request as -
  * Sends the task to the computer's file system.
  * Ready to handle the next request.
  * When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
* Node.js can do -
  * Node.js can generate dynamic page content
  * Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
  * Node.js can collect form data
  * Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
* Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request. 
* Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

#### REACT
*  React is a front-end library developed by Facebook.
* ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components.
* React abstracts away the DOM, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. 
#### EXPRESS
* ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends.
* Advantages of express -
  * Makes Node.js web application development fast and easy. 
  * Easy to configure and customize. 
  * Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs. 
  * Includes various middleware modules which you can use to perform additional tasks on request and response. 
  * Allows you to define an error handling middleware. 
  * Allows you to create REST API server. 
  * Easy to connect with databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySQL .
#### MONGODB
* MongoDB is an open-source document database and NoSQL database.
* MongoDB is written in C++.
* MongoDB is a *document-based* database management system which leverages a JSON-style storage format known as binary JSON, or BSON, to achieve high throughput. BSON makes it easy for applications to extract and manipulate data, as well as allowing properties to be efficiently indexed, mapped, and nested in support of complex query operations and expressions.
* MongoDB advantage -
  * **Schema less** − MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
  * Structure of a single object is clear.
  * No complex joins.
  * MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language .
  * Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
  * Uses internal memory for storing the working set, enabling faster access of data.
