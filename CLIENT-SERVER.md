#Client-Sever Model 
* The client-server model is a distributed communication framework of network processes among service requestors, clients and service providers.
* The client-server connection is established through a network or the Internet.
* A client requests specified data or processes. 
*  The server relays process output to the client. 
* The client-server model differs from a peer-to-peer (P2P) model where communicating systems are the client or server, each with equal status and responsibilities. The P2P model is decentralized networking. The client-server model is centralized networking.
* example - When a bank customer accesses online banking services with a web browser (the client), the client initiates a request to the bank’s web server. The customer’s login credentials may be stored in a database, and the web server accesses the database server as a client. An application server interprets the returned data by applying the bank’s business logic, and provides the output to the web server. Finally, the web server returns the result to the client web browser for display.
